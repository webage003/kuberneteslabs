Lab: 5 Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods

Lab Objective: This lab demonstrates how to assign memory request and a memory limit to a Container. 
Step: 1 Create a Namespace
Execute below command to create new namespace
kubectl create namespace my-namespace

Step:2  Create  a configuration file that creates a pod with memory request and memory limit as shown below

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "256Mi"
      limits:
        memory: "512Mi"

Step:3 Execute below command to create pod

kubectl create -f my-pod.yaml --namespace my-namespace

Step:4 Verify that the Pod Container is running
Execute below command to verify Pod container is running

kubectl get pods --namespace my-namespace

Step:5 View detailed information about the Pod
Execute below comma d to get  detailed information about the pod, including its resource usage

kubectl describe pod my-pod --namespace my-namespace

Summary :
In this lab task, we created a namespace in Kubernetes and then defined a pod configuration file with resource requests and limits for a container. We then used the configuration file to create a pod in the namespace, and verified that the pod was running using the kubectl get pods command. Finally, we viewed detailed information about the pod including its resource usage using the kubectl describe pod command.
