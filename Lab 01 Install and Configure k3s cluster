Facts to Remember:

K3s is a Kubernetes distribution developed by Rancher. Compared to some other Kubernetes distributions it’s lightweight, really easy to install and has only minimal operating system dependencies. One of the things that make it easy to use is, that many Kubernetes components are bundled in a single binary that bootstraps the Kubernetes installation.
